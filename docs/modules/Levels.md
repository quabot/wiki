#### When do you get XP?

**In a text channel:**
- You can only get XP every 3 seconds.
- You get between 1-5 XP per message, which is then multiplied by the server-configured multiplier. You get an additional 1 extra XP if your message is longer than 200 characters. This extra XP point is not multiplied by the configured multiplier.

**In a voice channel:**
- You can only get XP every 60 seconds that you are in a voice channel.
- This 60 seconds timer resets when you re-join the voice channel.
- You get between 1-10 XP per minute, which is then multiplied by the server-configured multiplier.

**When sending commands**
- You can only get XP every 12 seconds.
- You get between 1-3XP per command, which is then multiplied by the server-configured multiplier.
