### Variables

The `Embed Builder` also supports a range of useful variables, which can be used in your embed.

Different modules have different available variables, but some are universal.<br/>
<!-- ![Basic Variables](./img/EmbedBuilder-Variables.png) -->

When you enter a variable in your message, it'll automatically be replaced with the appropriate data. 

- **Static variables**: These can't be changed directly by the user.  
  **Example:** `{server.name}` will show the server's name.
  
- **Dynamic variables**: These can be changed based on user input.  
  **Example:** `{@&role_id}` will mention the role based on the role ID you provide.

## FAQ

- **Q:** Why does the `Preview` window show incorrect data for variables?<br/>
  **A:** In the `Preview` window, many variables are replaced with placeholder data. The final message will display the correct values.

- **Q:** Why isn't the variable preview showing up?<br/>
  **A:** The variable preview doesn't always display in the builder, but it will show up in the final message.
