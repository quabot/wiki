# Premium

We recently added our small premium subscription to help support the bot's development and cover costs. Premium is completely optional. You can find our premium policy [here](https://quabot.net/policies) for subscription-related information.

## Why go premium?

By going premium, you help support the bot's development and cover costs. This allows us to continue improving QuaBot and adding new features based on user feedback. You get access to a number of exclusive features, the full list can be found below. Premium is only $1,99 per month, which is a small price to pay for the added functionality and the support you provide.

## Premium Features

:::note
Each update tries to add more premium features, whilst keeping the free tier as feature-rich as possible. We view premium as optional support, not a requirement to use the bot.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where do i subscribe?
You can subscribe to premium by using the `/premium` command in your server or by visiting our [premium page](https://quabot.net/premium). You can only pay with a credit card, charged monthly. Payments are handled securely through Stripe.

### How do i cancel my subscription?
You can cancel your subscription at any time through the [premium page](https://quabot.net/premium). Your subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing cycle.

### Can i buy premium for just one server?
Premium is purchased per server, but you can buy premium for multiple servers if you wish. Each server will have its own subscription that is billed separately on different dates.


### Can someone else manage premium for my server?
Only you can manage a subscription you started and only staff members (with dashboard access) can start a subscription for a server. Regular users cannot buy premium for a server at this time. Other staff members can still view the premium status and change premium settings, but they cannot cancel or change the subscription on your behalf.
