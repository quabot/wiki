# The QuaBot Wiki

Welcome to the QuaBot wiki, this wiki is created to help you use QuaBot.

QuaBot is the perfect Discord bot, it has advanced modules ranging from giveaways, reaction roles, logging to applications and so much more.

## Inviting QuaBot

You can invite QuaBot to your server by visiting [invite.quabot.net](https://invite.quabot.net). You can also join our [support server](https://discord.quabot.net) for help and support.

When inviting QuaBot, it will prompt you to select the server you want to invite it to. Select the server and click continue.
You then need to select a few permissions, which are pre-selected. 
After selecting the server, you will be taken to the dashboard where you can configure the bot. More info about getting started with the dashboard can be found [here](/docs/getting-started).

## Required Permissions

You can use the Administrator permission. This will make sure QuaBot works, but it is not required, and you should not give Administrator to bots/users you do not trust.

## QuaBot Role Position

:::caution Warning
Please make sure that the QuaBot role is above all roles it should manage. If the role is below for example the members role, it cannot give this role to members. (More info below)
:::

QuaBot requires the `QuaBot` role to be above all roles it should manage. This is to ensure that QuaBot can manage the roles properly. If the role is below for example the members role, it cannot give this role to members. You can move the role by dragging it in the role list in the server settings. If you're having trouble with this, you can always ask for help in our [support server](https://discord.quabot.net).
