# About QuaBot

### Who are we?
We are a team of developers that are working on providing the best Discord bot for your server. We are constantly working on improving our bot and adding new features to it. We always had the problem where we needed multiple bots to do different things in our server. One bot for suggestions, one for tickets, one for moderation and so on. We decided to create a bot that can do all of these things and more. That's how QuaBot was born.

We are currently a team of 2 developers, but we are looking to expand our team in the future. We have Joa_sss, the CEO and Frontend/API developer and Dagan, the Bot developer. We are both passionate about what we do and we are always looking for ways to improve our bot and make it better for you. We are always open to suggestions and feedback, so if you have any, feel free to join our [Discord server](https://discord.quabot.net) and let us know.

### What does QuaBot do?
QuaBot basically does everything a Discord server needs. Anything that isn't hyper specific can be done by QuaBot. We have suggestions, tickets, levels and a lot more. A full list of modules can be found [here (coming soon)](/docs). QuaBot is also fully customizable, you can enable/disable each module, change a lot of settings and even customize the messages it responds with. We offer a lot of features for free, that some other bots have paywalls for. We do not plan to paywall any existing features. We have a lot of features planned for the future, and we're super excited to have you here for the ride. So what are you waiting for? [Invite QuaBot to your server](https://invite.quabot.net) and start using it today!
