# About QuaBot

### Who are we?
We are a team of developers that are working on providing the best Discord bot for your server. Our goal is to create a single bot that handles all your server needs, whether it's suggestions, tickets, moderation, or more. QuaBot was born out of the need to combine multiple functionalities into one powerful bot, reducing the need for multiple bots.

We are currently a small but passionate team, continuously improving QuaBot and adding new features based on user feedback. We are always looking for ways to make the bot better and more useful for you. If you have any suggestions, feel free to join our [Discord server](https://discord.quabot.net) and share your thoughts with us.

### What does QuaBot do?
QuaBot covers everything a Discord server need, from suggestions and tickets to levels and more. You can find a full list of modules [here (coming soon)](/docs/category/modules). QuaBot is fully customizable, allowing you to enable/disable individual modules, adjust settings, and customize responses. We offer many features for free that other bots often charge for, and we do not plan to put existing features behind paywalls.

With exciting features planned for the future, we're thrilled to have you on board. So what are you waiting for? [Invite QuaBot to your server](https://invite.quabot.net) and start using it today!
